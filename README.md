This is a Quarantine Dasboard App. I have used React-Redux, CSS and JSX for this Project

There are two files in the Folder Pages for two Web Pages for this Web App one file is LogIn.js and other is dashboard.js

LogIn Page is where you put your credentials and after clicking on Submit Button you will be redirected to the Dashboard Page. I have put link for the Dasboard Page under onClick Event.

In the Quartantine Page you will see all the messages and the link is provided. On Clicking "Click here" you will be directed to the full document uploaded by the Admin.

Admins only will have Right and Read access to Database and Users will have only Read Access. These are part of Backend and in this project I have not worked on Backend Technology.

Since we are storing Mobile Number and Email Id of Users. So, whenever new notification will come we can send notifications to the Users.

You can easily change Fonts, Add Logos and Color Schemes using App.css

We can esily Switch this Web App to Mobile App using React Native. Since, the Codes are easily replicable from React DOM to React Native
